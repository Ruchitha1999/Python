# About My Python project
The project involves working with three datasets: Project, Employee, and Seniority Level, and performing various data manipulation tasks using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

### The project consists of 10 tasks:
1.	Create three separate data frames from the given tables and save them as .csv files. 
2.	Handle missing values in the "Cost" column of the Project data frame by replacing them with a running average using a for loop. 
3.	Split the "Name" column in the Employee data frame into "First Name" and "Last Name" columns, and remove the original "Name" column. 
4.	Merge all three data frames into a single data frame named "Final." 
5.	Add a "Bonus" column to the Final data frame, calculating a 5% bonus on the project cost for employees who completed their projects. 
6.	Demote the designation level by 1 for employees whose projects failed, and remove records of employees whose designation level exceeds 4. 
7.	Add prefixes "Mr." and "Mrs." to the "First Name" column based on gender, and drop the "Gender" column. 
8.	Promote the designation level by 1 for employees aged above 29 years using an if condition. 
9.	Create a new data frame "TotalProjCost" with columns "ID," "First Name," and "Total Cost," summing up the project costs for each employee. 
10.	Print details of employees whose city name contains the letter "o."

    
### I have completed all the tasks by performing below steps:

-	Data Preparation: Created three data frames from the provided tables and saved them as .csv files using Pandas. 
-	Data Cleaning: Used a for loop to calculate and replace missing values in the "Cost" column with a running average. 
-	Data Transformation: Split the "Name" column into "First Name" and "Last Name," removed the original column, and added prefixes to the "First Name" column based on gender.
-	Data Integration: Merged the three data frames into a single "Final" data frame using Pandas' merge function. 
-	Data Analysis: Added a "Bonus" column, calculated designation level changes based on project status, and promoted employees based on age using conditional statements. 
-	Data Aggregation: Created a new data frame "TotalProjCost" to calculate the total project cost for each employee. 
-	Data Filtering: Filtered and printed employee details based on city names containing the letter "o." 


### Result:
-	Successfully completed all 10 tasks using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
-	Generated clean and well-structured .csv files for the three initial data frames. 
-	Produced a comprehensive "Final" data frame with all required transformations and calculations. 
-	Created a new data frame "TotalProjCost" summarizing project costs for each employee. 
-	Filtered and displayed employee details based on city names containing "o."
